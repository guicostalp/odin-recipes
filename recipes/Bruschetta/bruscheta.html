   <h1>Bruschetta</h1> 
   
   <!--Introduction-->

   <h2>Pronounced <em>"brusketta"</em>, this classic Italian appetizer is a perfect way to capture the flavors of garden ripened tomatoes, fresh basil, garlic, and olive oil.
       <p>Think of it as summer on toast!</p>
   </h2>

   <h3>It's perfect for a party because you can make a large batch of the topping ahead of time, as well as toasting baguette slices.
       <p>Either bring out a bowl of the bruschetta topping for people to put on their own toasts, or do it for them right before serving.</p>
   </h3>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>6 to 7 ripe tomatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds)</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</li>
                <li>6 to 8 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced or chopped</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon sea salt, more or less to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more or less to taste</li>
                <li>1 baguette, French bread, or similar Italian bread</li>
                <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Blanch and peel the tomatoes
                    <p>Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes (this will make the tomatoes easier to peel).</p>
                    <p> Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 450째F (230째C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.</li>
                <li>Toast the baguette slices
                    <p>Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan.</p>
                    <p>The baguette slices will toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all.</p>
                    <p> When the oven has reached 450째F (230째C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.</p>
                </li> 
                <li>Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture
                    <p>Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).</p>
                    <p>Either serve the toasts plain with a bowl of the tomato bruschetta mixture on the side for people to top their own, or use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
